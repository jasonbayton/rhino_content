The guidelines are based on standards that were developed by independent scientific organizations through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies. The standards include a substantial safety margin designed to assure the safety of all persons regardless of age or health.

FCC RF Exposure Information and Statement The SAR limit of USA (FCC) is 1.6 W/kg averaged over one gram of tissue. Device types: Tablet (FCC ID: 2AUOUT8) has also been tested against this SAR limit. The highest SAR value reported under this standard during product certification for use at the **body is** 1.6 W/kg. This device was tested for typical body-worn operations with the back of the handset kept **0 mm** from the body. To maintain compliance with FCC RF exposure requirements, use accessories that maintain a **0 mm** separation distance between the user&#39;s body and the back of the handset. The use of belt clips, holsters and similar accessories should not contain metallic components in its assembly. The use of accessories that do not satisfy these requirements may not comply with FCC RF exposure requirements and should be avoided.

**Body Operation**

This device was tested for typical body-worn operations. To comply with RF exposure requirements, a minimum separation distance of **0 cm** must be maintained between the user&#39;s body and the handset, including the antenna. Third-party belt-clips, holsters, and similar accessories used by this device should not contain any metallic components. Body-worn accessories that do not meet these requirements may not comply with RF exposure requirements and should be avoided. Use only the supplied or an approved antenna.

## Warning for 5G Wi-Fi

The device for operation in the band 5150–5250 MHz is only for indoor use to reduce the potential for harmful interference to co-channel mobile satellite systems

The device shall automatically discontinue transmission in cases of absence of information to transmit, or operational failure. Then it will scan the available radio signals. If this signal is connected before, it will be automatically connected, otherwise manual connections will be necessary.

In all EU member states, operation of 5150-5350 MHz is restricted to indoor use only.

This restriction will be applied in all EU member states.
