This release includes security and stability improvements, including the May SPL and an enhancement to mobile network config to allow for the prevention of fallback on carrier networks that do not otherwise permit device registration.

Access the new setting via __Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Advanced > Prevent fallback (toggle on & off)__. In a future release this will be an automatic toggle based on recognition of SIM products that require this; and of course if you find a network that relies on disabling fallback that doesn't allow you to automatically register, please reach out to the Support Team via support@rhinomobility.com with details of your network provider so we can add them into a scheduled release.
