If your Rhino device has booted into a black screen with large, white/yellow text, you may have booted inadvertently into our factory test mode.

This tool allows us to adequately test each device for any obvious defects before it's shipped from the factory, and is only invoked through a specific combination of keys.

Unfortunately holding your Rhino device in such a way that buttons other than power are depressed when powering on the device may lead to this mode, but it's simple enough to recover from:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Press and hold the power button for up to 30 seconds
2. When the screen fully blacks out, remove your finger from the power button
</div>

If you find yourself or your users landing in this mode frequently, please reach out to the [Rhino team](/support/escalate) for assistance.
