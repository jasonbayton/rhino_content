Unless otherwise indicated by the product user guide, you may clean your RHINO device as follows:

**DO**: Use a dampened, lint-free cloth and wipe gently over all surfaces  
**DO**: Wipe down the unit as frequently as is demanded for its use case

**DO NOT**: Use harsh chemicals or detergents  
**DO NOT**: Submerge in water  
**DO NOT**: Use abrasive materials  
**DO NOT**: Block ports, vents or other in/outlets

Your RHINO device may have an antibacterial solution for healthcare settings, and due care should be taken not to remove this.

_NB:_ If chemicals are used to wipe down the screen on units not coated with a chemical resistant solution, the oleophobic coating will be removed and fingerprints will most certainly become more pronounced during use. This is not covered under warranty, and a oleophobic solution may need to be purchased and applied to impacted devices in order to restore resistance to natural oils.
