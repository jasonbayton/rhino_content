It'll now be possible to plug your Rhino device into a computer and undertake various debugging tasks. When first plugging in, the device will prompt for authorisation. Allow this.

## Take a bug report

With developer options enabled:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Open Settings
  1. Either swipe up from the home screen to display the app drawer, and select settings, or
  2. Swipe down from the notification area and tap the settings icon present in the notification panel.
2. Tap System
3. Tap Advanced
4. Tap Developer options
5. Swipe until bug report appears in view, and tap **Take a bug report**
</div>

The bug report will become available via a notification within a few moments. From there, share it to a preferred application or download it to a connected computer.

Alternatively, from ADB run `adb bugreport E:\Reports\MyBugReports` (choose an appropriate location) to save a bug report directly to your computer without interacting with the device directly.
