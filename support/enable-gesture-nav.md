Rhino devices running Android 10 and above default to 3-button navigation due to its familiarity and ease of use.

Should you wish to change to gesture navigation and benefit from full-screen applications, do the following:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Open **Settings**
  1. Either swipe up from the home screen to display the app drawer, and select settings, or
  2. Swipe down from the notification area and tap the settings icon present in the notification panel.
2. Tap **System**
3. Tap **Gestures**
4. Tap **System navigation**
5. Tap **Gesture navigation** to enable it
</div>

Gesture navigation will apply immediately, please note:

- Going home requires a swipe up from the bottom of the screen
- Going back requires a swipe from either the left of right edge of the screen
- Opening recent apps requires a partial swipe up and hold from the bottom of the screen
- Engaging the Google assistant requires a diagonal swipe from the bottom corners of the screen

Reverting to 3-button navigation can be achieved by re-following the steps above, opting for 3-button navigation in step 5.
