The Wi-Fi radio on your RHINO device provides as much as 300feet (100M) range of wireless network access and supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. If you use your device to connect to the internet, you may choose to connect to a wireless access point. Wi-Fi is enabled by default on RHINO devices, however can be turned off or back on as follows.

## How to manage the Wi-Fi radio:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Via Settings
  1. Open **Settings** available either in the app drawer (swipe up from the home screen) or by swiping down from the status bar and tapping the settings icon(<span class="material-icons">settings</span>). Alternatively, swipe down from the status bar and long-tap on the Wi-Fi icon(<span class="material-icons">wifi</span>) within the Quick Settings panel.
  2. In Settings, tap **Network & Internet**, then toggle to on(<span class="material-icons">toggle_on</span>) or off(<span class="material-icons">toggle_off</span>) Wi-Fi.
2. Via Quick Settings
  1. Swipe down from the status bar and tap the Wi-Fi icon(<span class="material-icons">wifi</span>) within the Quick Settings panel. This will toggle the Wi-Fi radio on/off as required.
</div>

**Note:** By default, Android will occasionally re-enable Wi-Fi when a detected, known Wi-Fi network is in range. This can be disabled in **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Wi-Fi** > **Wi-Fi preferences** > **Turn on Wi-Fi automatically**.

**Note:** By default, Android will occasionally prompt to connect to any detected open Wi-Fi networks in the immediate area, as indicated with a silent notification in the notification bar. Open networks may be dangerous. To disable this, head to **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Wi-Fi** > **Wi-Fi preferences** > **Notify for public networks**.

## How to connect to a Wi-Fi network:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Within **Settings** > **Network & internet** > **Wi-Fi**, a list of Wi-Fi networks will display along with authentication in use (e.g. WPA).
2. Tap on a preferred Wi-Fi network, and connect with the known Wi-Fi network credentials.
3. Once the RHINO device is connected to Wi-Fi, the SSID will display "Connected" beneath it, with a Wi-Fi indicator to its left(<span class="material-icons">wifi</span>), with the approximate signal strength (the number of lit bars). If you touch the connected network, it will display the name of Wi-Fi network, status, speed, signal, strength, security, information, and IP address.
