Your Rhino M10p is designed to run on a permanent power source and therefore does _not_ have a battery. To prevent potential issues with the OS when power is lost, including corruption, data loss, or memory issues, the M10p leverages an intelligent power-down system in the event of mains power loss.

In order for this to function, it charges up when the unit is plugged in. This can incur a delay when powering on after periods of the unit being unplugged or completely switched off as it takes a short time to initially charge.

This system provides no user feedback, and as such may look like nothing is happening. It is perfectly normal to expect a 5-10 second delay after plugging in, and the unit will power on as soon as the power-down system has completely charged.

If after 5-10 seconds the device still hasn't powered on:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Remove all cables
2. Toggle the power switch to off
3. Reinsert the power cable
4. Toggle the power switch to on (the unit will beep)
5. Wait 5-10 seconds
</div>

Any delay beyond this (30s+) please [escalate to support](/support/escalate).
