Your Rhino M10p is designed to run on a permanent power source. To prevent potential issues with the OS when power is lost, the M10p leverages an intelligent power-down system in the event of mains power loss.

In order for this to function, it sits between the M10p and the power source, and charges up when the unit is plugged in and turned on. This can incur a delay when powering on after periods of the unit being unplugged or completely switched off.

It is perfectly normal, and the unit will power on as soon as the power-down system has completely charged.
