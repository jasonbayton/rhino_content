When enrolling a Rhino device into SOTI MobiControl, you may encounter the following error:

`Enrollment failed. This device is not SafetyNet compliant. Please contact your system administrator`

This is _not_ an issue with Rhino, as all Rhino models are GMS certified and SafetyNet compliant from factory. This is a known, random issue which occurs when enrolling into SOTI MobiControl. The SOTI team are aware of it.

Should this error show during enrolment, please wipe and retry.

If it continues to happen, you may either
