Factory resetting a device is always recommended before parting ways with it to ensure any and all personal or private information has been removed. Likewise, resetting a device may resolve issues where other attempted solutions have not prevailed.

All Rhino devices can be reset in the following way:

1. Go to Settings
  1. Either swipe up from the home screen to display the app drawer, and select settings, or
  2. Swipe down from the notification area and tapp the settings icon present in the notification panel.
2. Tap System
3. Tap Reset options
4. Tap factory reset
5. Accept the prompt

The Rhino device will begin the irreversible process of resetting the device back to factory settings, and will become available to be set back up again within several minutes.

_Tip:_ While the device is resetting, please don't press buttons or attempt to interrupt the process. It may take some time to complete the reset process, but interrupting it may cause corruption or boot errors.

_Zero-touch_: If the device is zero-touch registered with an organisation, performing a factory reset of the device will not remove the zero-touch configuration, and the device will re-enrol into enterprise management automatically on attempting to set the device up again. If the device should not remain zero-touch registered, please remove it via the [zero-touch portal](https://partner.android.com/zerotouch).
