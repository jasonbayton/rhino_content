Factory resetting a device is always recommended before parting ways with it to ensure any and all personal or private information has been removed. Likewise, resetting a device may resolve issues where other attempted solutions have not prevailed. Depending on the state of the device, resetting it to a factory-like state can be achieved in one of two ways.

## With access to the Android OS

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Open Settings
  1. Either swipe up from the home screen to display the app drawer, and select settings, or
  2. Swipe down from the notification area and tap the settings icon present in the notification panel.
2. Tap System
3. Tap Reset options
4. Tap factory reset
5. Accept the prompt
6. The Rhino device will begin the irreversible process of resetting the device back to factory settings, and will become available to be set back up again within several minutes.

## With no access to the Android OS

Assuming the device will not boot, or the end-user is locked out of the device because of a forgotten/changed passcode, it may be possible to recover through Rhino recovery mode.

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Follow steps outlined [here](/support/boot-to-recovery) to boot the Rhino device into recovery mode. Once the recovery menu is shown, use the volume keys to move up and down through the menu, pressing power to confirm.
2. Select **Wipe data/factory reset**
3. Select and confirm **Factory reset data**

_Tip:_ While the device is resetting, please don't press buttons or attempt to interrupt the process. It may take some time to complete the reset process, but interrupting it may cause corruption or boot errors.

_Zero-touch_: If the device is zero-touch registered with an organisation, performing a factory reset of the device will not remove the zero-touch configuration, and the device will re-enrol into enterprise management automatically on attempting to set the device up again. If the device should not remain zero-touch registered, please remove it via the [zero-touch portal](https://partner.android.com/zerotouch).  

_Enterprise management_: EMM policies may prevent resetting of the device, both via Android Settings, and recovery. Should a device fail to boot/allow access with policies set, the device may need to be sent in to the [Rhino team](/support/escalate) for repair.
