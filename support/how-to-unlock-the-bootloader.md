Rhino devices ship with a locked bootloader by default. This is a requirement for a Google certified device generally. As an enterprise-targeted device, the unlocking of the bootloader typically possible on consumer devices is not permitted by default on Rhino devices.

In order for a bootloader to be unlocked the user of the device must have an authorisation code provided by the Rhino team after submission of the request via a dedicated, known customer representative or approved partner.

This significantly reduces the risk of device tampering, rooting, and the voiding of the Rhino Warranty.

We appreciate there may be legitimate use cases where an organisation may desire the bootloader is unlockable, and we encourage customers to get in touch if this is a requirement.

Once approved, the Rhino team will provide the authorisation code for the device(s) in question, and instructions on how to perform the unlock.
