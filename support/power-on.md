## T8/C10

Power on your device by holding the power button on the **top left** of the unit. The button should be pressed for 2-3s in order for it to boot.

## T5se / R6 / PACE A1

Power on your device by holding the power button on the **right hand side** of the unit. The button should be pressed for 2-3s in order for it to boot.

## T6p

Power on your device by holding the power button on the **left hand side** of the unit. The button should be pressed for 2-3s in order for it to boot.

## M10p / K27p

Locate the physical power switch on the back of the unit and switch it to the **on** position. Note there is no battery in this unit, so it **must** be connected to a permanent power source in order for the unit to power on.

NB: It is not supported by the unit to be powered down with the respective power keys (separate from the switches) and remain off. These units are designed to boot automatically when external power is detected and the power _switches_ are in the **on** position.

## DS

The unit will automatically boot when connected to a power source.
