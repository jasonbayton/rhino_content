If an installed application is misbehaving, you may choose to force close it, clear its data, or fully remove it. Here's how to do so:

<div class="numbered-instructions" markdown="1">
1. Open **Settings**
  1. Either swipe up from the home screen to display the app drawer, and select settings, or
  2. Swipe down from the notification area and tap the settings icon present in the notification panel.
2. Tap **Apps & notifications**
3. Tap **See all apps** or **App info** depending on your OS version
4. Locate in the list your desired application and tap it
5. You may now opt to undertake the following:
  1. **OPEN** - Opens the application
  2. **DISABLE/UNINSTALL** - For system applications, it may be possible to disable the app. For non-system apps, this will show uninstall
  3. **FORCE STOP** - This will immediately terminate the app, and may lead to data loss
6. You may also choose to clear app data/cache to "reset" an app back to a just-installed state:
  1. Tap **Storage & cache**
  2. Tap **CLEAR STORAGE** - wipe all app data
  3. Tap **CLEAR CACHE** - wipe only temporary app cache
</div>

If the application is still misbehaving and/or the above solutions didn't work as expected, reach out to the [support team](/support/escalate) for assistance.
